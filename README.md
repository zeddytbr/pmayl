This is a simple email program that I made in python. It is currently in development and does not work.

Take this in to account:

    This program has currently been tested with only gmail. It will likely not work with other providers. 
    
    This software has not been tested for security, DO NOT use it for any confidential or personal. This project was only created to learn a bit about software development.
    
    It can not view mail, this software can only send it.
    
    No passwords are stored. While this is a feature I would like to bring in, I need to figure out a way of doing it without using plain text.

Instructions to use:

    Run "pmayl-login.py".
    
    Enter your email and password.
    
    Press OK
    
    Fill out the recipient, subject and main body form (Attatchments are not yet supported)
    
    Hit send.
    
    (This does not currently work, please wait until release).
    
With that out of the way, please enjoy this piece of software.
