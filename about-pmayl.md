# PmaYl
This is a simple email program that I made in python. It is currently in development and does not work.

# Take this in to account:

    This program has currently been tested with only gmail. It will likely not work with other providers. 
    
    This software has not been tested for security, DO NOT use it for any confidential or personal. This project was only created to learn a bit about software development.
    
    It can not view mail, this software can only send it.
    
    No passwords are stored. While this is a feature I would like to bring in, I need to figure out a way of doing it without using plain text.

# Instructions to use:

    Run "start-pymayl.py".
    
    Enter your email and password.
    
    Press OK
    
    Fill out the recipient, subject and main body form (Attatchments are not yet supported)
    
    Hit send.
    
    (This does not currently work, please wait until release).

# Changes I would like to make in the future:
    
    Currently, the design is unattractive. I would like to change from TKinter to another GUI library like Kivy. This will likely change after the first official release.
    
    I would also like to make it clearer wherether login has been successful or not.
    
    It would be good if I could allow people to use it in order to read and manage emails, not just send them. However, I think that is beyond my level at this point in time but could be an addition in the future.

With that out of the way, please enjoy this piece of software.
